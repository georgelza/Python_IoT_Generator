# Python based IoT SimeSeries data generator

## Overview

At this point we have a list of sites for which we want to creation IoT data streams, for each site we have a list of devices and for each device we have a list of sensors and their parameters.

### Our Target payload :
```
	{
		"timestamp" : "2024-10-19T01:00:00.869Z",
		"metadata" : {
			"siteId" : 1009,
			"deviceId" : 1042,
			"sensorId" : 10180,
			"unit" : "Psi"
		},
		"measurement" : 1015.3997
	}
```
